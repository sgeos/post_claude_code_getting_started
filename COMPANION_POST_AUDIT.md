# POST_AUDIT.md

This document is an audit of the companion blog post "Getting Started with Claude Code" generated by Claude Code (Opus 4.5).

## Overall Assessment

The post provides a comprehensive introduction to Claude Code with practical depth. The structure progresses logically from installation through configuration to a real-world example, concluding with lessons learned. The CPMM calculator example demonstrates agentic workflow effectively.

## Strengths

### Pedagogical Structure
- Clear progression: setup → concepts → practice → reflection
- Keybinding tables provide quick reference value
- The four-component model (Model, Context, Prompt, Tools) offers a useful mental framework

### Technical Accuracy
- CLAUDE.md hierarchy (global → project → subdirectory) correctly documented
- Build commands and WASM deployment instructions are accurate
- CPMM mathematics presented correctly

### Honest Assessment
- The "Specification Issues" section demonstrates intellectual honesty about prompt ambiguity
- Key lesson that "results reflect input clarity, not model limitations" is well-supported by the example
- Appropriately positions agentic AI as "force multiplier, not replacement"

## Areas for Consideration

### Prompt Specification
The original prompt provided to generate this calculator was somewhat ambiguous regarding:
- Whether reserve fields should be editable (they are not)
- Whether delta values should be gross or net-of-fee (currently gross)
- The exact fee collection semantics (input-side vs output-side)

These ambiguities were resolved by the model using reasonable defaults, but the post correctly identifies this as a specification issue rather than a model limitation.

### Missing Context
The post references but does not fully explain:
- Agent Hooks mechanism
- 300 Line Rule for context management
- Sub-agent spawning patterns
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Marking these as "future study" topics is appropriate for an introductory post.

### Code Quality Observations
The generated code in this repository:
- Passes `cargo clippy` with zero warnings
- Includes 7 unit tests covering core mathematical operations
- Uses idiomatic Rust patterns (`Rc<RefCell<_>>` for shared state)
- Properly handles web-sys type conversions

One potential improvement: the `attach_input_listener` function captures the input element twice (once for the closure, once for the listener attachment), which could be simplified.

## Terminology Consistency

The post uses consistent terminology:
- "Agentic AI" vs "AI agent" (prefers former)
- "CLAUDE.md" always uppercase and with extension
- "Sonnet 4.5" and "Opus 4.5" for model names

## Factual Verification

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Claude Code version 2.1.17 | Plausible (cannot verify) |
| Shift+Tab cycles permission modes | Accurate |
| CLAUDE.md loaded hierarchically | Accurate |
| wasm-pack outputs to pkg/ | Verified |
| CPMM formulas (x·y=k, P=y/x) | Mathematically correct |

## Recommendations

1. **Prompt Engineering Section**: Consider adding explicit guidance on specification completeness, given the lessons learned from the delta calculation ambiguity.

2. **Error Handling Example**: The post could benefit from showing how Claude Code handles build failures or test failures during development.

3. **Interactive Elements**: The embedded WASM calculator is an excellent demonstration. Consider adding a second, simpler example to show the minimal viable integration.

4. **Version Sensitivity**: Note that keybindings and features may change between Claude Code versions. A "last verified" date would help readers.

## Conclusion

The post successfully achieves its stated goal of introducing Claude Code with sufficient depth for practical use. The CPMM calculator example provides concrete evidence of agentic AI capabilities while honestly addressing the critical role of specification quality. The emphasis on human accountability and engineering judgment positions the technology appropriately.
